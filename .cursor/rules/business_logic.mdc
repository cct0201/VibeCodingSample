When implementing or modifying the `/get-articles` endpoint in `app.py`:

*   **Core Logic:** The endpoint **must** randomly select article URLs from the `article_sources` list.
*   **Uniqueness:** The selected URLs **must** be unique. Do not return duplicate URLs in the same response. `random.sample()` is suitable for this purpose.
*   **Quantity:**
    *   If the number of unique URLs in `article_sources` is 3 or more, the endpoint **must** return exactly 3 unique URLs.
    *   If the number of unique URLs in `article_sources` is less than 3, the endpoint **must** return all available unique URLs.
*   **JSON Response Format:**
    *   On success, the response **must** be a JSON object containing a key "articles" with a list of selected URL strings as its value. Example: `{"articles": ["url1", "url2", "url3"]}`.
    *   On failure (for example, if an internal error occurs during the selection process), the response **should** be a JSON object indicating the error. Example: `{"error": "Failed to retrieve articles"}`. Appropriate HTTP status codes (such as 500) should be used.
*   **Data Source:** Currently, the `article_sources` list is hardcoded in `app.py`. Ensure that this list variable is referenced correctly.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement basic `try...except` blocks around the core logic (such as random selection) to catch potential exceptions and return the JSON error response format described above.
