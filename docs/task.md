## System Design Summary

- **Architecture Overview**: Lightweight Flask backend providing HTML and JSON endpoints
- **Interfaces**: `/` (renders homepage) and `/get-articles` (returns 3 random article links)
- **Data Model**: No persistent model, article sources are hardcoded list
- **Edge Cases**: Source list may have fewer than 3 items, URLs must not repeat
