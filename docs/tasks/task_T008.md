# Task ID: T008
# Title: Create requirements file
# Status: TO-DO
# Dependencies: -
# Priority: Low
# Description: Set up requirements.txt with dependencies
# Estimated time: S

# Details:
Create a requirements.txt file in the project root directory:
1. Include Flask as the primary dependency with a specific version (e.g., Flask==2.0.1)
2. Add any other necessary dependencies for the project
3. Keep the list minimal, as per project constraints
4. Use specific versions for all dependencies to ensure reproducibility
5. Add comments explaining what each dependency is used for

The file should contain at least:
```
Flask==2.0.1  # Web framework
```

# Acceptance Criteria:
- requirements.txt file exists in the project root
- File includes Flask with a specific version
- All dependencies have pinned versions
- Dependencies are minimal (only what's actually needed)
- Project can be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- All application functionality works after installing from requirements.txt

# Test Strategy:
- Create a new virtual environment
- Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the application to verify it works with the specified dependencies
- Check for any import errors or missing dependencies
- Verify that no unnecessary dependencies are included
