# Task ID: T001
# Title: Set up Flask application structure
# Status: TO-DO
# Dependencies: -
# Priority: High
# Description: Create basic Flask app with project structure and configurations
# Estimated time: S

# Details:
Create the initial Flask application structure following these steps:
1. Create app.py file at the root level of the project
2. Import necessary Flask libraries and modules
3. Initialize the Flask application instance
4. Create the required directories:
   - templates/ for HTML templates
   - static/ for CSS, JS, and other static assets
5. Set up basic Flask configuration (debug mode, etc.)
6. Add a simple "if __name__ == '__main__'" block to run the app

# Acceptance Criteria:
- Project structure follows the plan layout
- Flask app initializes without errors
- Server can be started with `flask run` or by running app.py
- Directory structure includes templates/ and static/ folders
- App is properly configured for development

# Test Strategy:
- Run the application to verify it starts without errors
- Check console output for any warnings or errors
- Verify the server responds to basic requests
- Confirm the directory structure matches the project plan
